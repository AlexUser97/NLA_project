# NLA_project - Eigenjoy Enthusiasts
The goal of this project is to select the best interpolation method for a coarse grid of novier stokes. And also to analyse the applicability of linear matrices for read-only solutions of this equation

# First steps

First of all, we have selected the boundary conditions for the Novier-Stokes equation. 

Then this equation was solved numerically for two cases of vortex laminar flow and for laminar flow in a pipe. For laminar flow in a pipe, the Novier-Stokes equation was solved analytically.
